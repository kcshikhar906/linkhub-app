          About LinkHub
        </h1>

          <p>
            LinkHub is a clean, hyper-efficient, and universally accessible
            digital directory. It acts as a centralized bridge between users and
            essential government or institutional services by cutting through the
            clutter of official websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of searching through multiple pages filled with legal jargon,
            users come to LinkHub to find a simple, human-readable explanation of
            any process, a clear, step-by-step guide on how to complete it, and a
            direct deep link to the exact page on the official website where the
            action must be taken. Itâ€™s the ultimate "get things done" utility for
            navigating bureaucratic processes.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground pt-4 font-headline">Our Vision</h2>
          <p>
            Initially, the app serves two primary groups: Nepalese individuals
            living in Australia who need to navigate Australian systems, and
            Australians who also find government websites overwhelming. The
            long-term vision is to create a scalable framework where the
            platform can be easily expanded to include any country, making it an
            indispensable tool for global citizens, immigrants, and anyone
            seeking clarity.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground pt-4 font-headline">Our Commitment</h2>
          <p>
            The design is minimal, professional, and completely free of ads or
            sponsored links to build absolute trust. The value is in the utility,
            not manipulation. We rely on community feedback to keep links accurate
            and information up-to-date, fostering a sense of collective
            ownership.
